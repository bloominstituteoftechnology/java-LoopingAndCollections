### Introduction and Hook

Let's Explore Java!

Like most languages Java has

* loops
* conditionals and branching
* collections - arrays and such

But being strongly typed and Object Oriented, these standard things do come with a twist in Java. Let's take a look!

### Purpose

Now that we have a foundation in Java, we need to add constructs that help us get the job done. So, let's do just that!

### Learning Activities

Create an application called `LoopingAndCollections` and a package called `loopingandcollections`

```BASH
<home dir><work dir>/LoopingAndCollections/src/loopingandcollections
```

Enter the code from `Dogs.java` into a file in the `loopingandcollections` folder called `Dog.java`. You will need to explain the interface Comparable and the method compareTo.

Enter the following code into a file in the `loopingandcollections` folder called `Main.java`. This is just to get started

```JAVA
package loopingandcollections;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Welcome to BloomTech's Java Module 2!!!");
    }
}
```

Wait on these:

* the gcd method will be entered for recursion at the end of the project!
* The random is for while loops

To run our code, we go through the following steps, running these commands from the `src` directory. These are steps to repeat after each change of the source code

```BASH
javac loopingandcollections/*.java
jar cvfe loopingandcollections.jar loopingandcollections.Main loopingandcollections/*.class
java -jar loopingandcollections.jar
```

So the order is

* Convert to bytecode
* Archive to a single file
* Execute the program

Remember

* c – create new archive file with given name
* v – generate verbose output
* f – specifies the jar output file to be created
* e – sets the main class also called the entry point

#### Conclusion

##### Review what we just learned

Today we covered some fundamental constructs of Java, useful statements we will be using as we go forward!

* Collections
* Loops
* Branching

##### How is this related to tomorrow's topic

* Tomorrow we will look at more Object Oriented Aspects of Java, especially related to inheritance and open and closed principles!
  * Interfaces
  * Abstract classes
  * Lambda Expressions
